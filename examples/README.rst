Examples
========

The example notebooks illustrate different functionality of the widgyts
package. Each is intended to show how widgyts can be used for your own
workflow. 

- ``galaxy_display.ipynb`` shows the monkeypatching feature between yt and
  widgyts to enable you to do interactive visualization directly on any yt
  dataset. 
- ``FRBViewer_tutorial.ipynb`` shows using the FRBViewer module of widgyts in
  conjunction with yt's data manipulation features. It illustrates some
  traitlet manipulation in the Colormaps module as well as traitlet linking
  between views of different fields. 
- ``datasetviewer_tutorial.ipynb`` shows how to use the dataset viewer.
