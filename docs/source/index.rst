Welcome to widgyts's documentation!
===================================

widyts is a fully client-side pan-and-zoom widget, using WebAssembly, for variable mesh
datasets from yt.  It runs in the browser, so once the data hits your notebook,
it's super fast and responsive!

If you'd like to dig into the Rust and WebAssembly portion of the code, you can
find it at `Github <https://github.com/data-exp-lab/rust-yt-tools/>`_ and in the npm
package `@data-exp-lab/yt-tools`.

Check out our `SciPy 2018 talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dl_m_6T2bU>`_
and the `associated slides <https://munkm.github.io/2018-07-13-scipy/>`_ for more info!
